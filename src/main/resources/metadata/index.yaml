description: "Tasks that manage DocumentDB collections with MongoDB-compatible insert, query, update, and delete operations."
body: "Connect to DocumentDB's HTTP API to insert, read, update, and delete collection data. Provide `host`, `database`, `collection`, `username`, and `password`; Insert handles one document or up to 10 via `documents`, Read supports filters or aggregation pipelines with `fetchType` output handling, and Update/Delete apply MongoDB-style filters with `updateMany`/`deleteMany` switches to control scope."
